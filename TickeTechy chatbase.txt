Ticket Assignment
AI-Powered Assignment

How does ticket assignment work?
Once a ticket is created, our AI evaluates the issue description, category, and urgency to assign the ticket to the most suitable agent. The assignment is then reviewed and approved by the admin for added accuracy.
Can I choose the agent for my ticket?
Our system automatically assigns tickets to ensure faster resolutions. However, if you have special preferences, you can note them in the ticket description, and the admin will review them.

AI-Managed Priority

Our AI analyzes the details of your ticket (e.g., keywords in the description, urgency indicators) and assigns a priority level: Low, Medium, High, or Critical. This ensures your ticket gets the attention it needs promptly.
Can I update the priority of my ticket?
The AI determines priority based on your input. If you feel the priority needs to change, update your ticket details, and the system will reassess.
